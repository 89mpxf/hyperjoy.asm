# hyperjoy.asm
so basically i felt randomly compelled to learn x86 assembly

## how this works
basically the boot loader just loads the kernel, and the kernel stores all of the image data / graphics processing. it all fits within the buffer so u can actually boot to this. i plan on making a windows trojan that overwrites the boot file with this cuz i think it'd be funny 

## build instructions
literally just run make.sh after you download this it's not that hard (you need nasm)

## faq
### why?
why not
### what positive effect does this have on your life
hoeppner you clearly do not understand that vga graphics written x86 assembly is the future of america
### why is the assembly is really poorly written
cope
